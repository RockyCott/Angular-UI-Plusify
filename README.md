# UI Plusify 🌟

A modular library of components and directives for Angular, designed to enhance your UI development experience. 🚀

## 🚧 Project Status

Angular UI Plusify is in active development. It currently includes the **Datetime Picker** and the new **Markdown Editor** components — with plans to continue growing into a comprehensive UI toolkit for Angular developers.

### Why Angular UI Plusify?

Each component is built for **Angular 16+**, designed with **modularity**, **customization**, and **future compatibility** in mind. For example:

- The **Datetime Picker** is a modern adaptation of [`@angular-material-components/datetime-picker`](https://github.com/h2qutc/angular-material-components), fully compatible with Angular Material 16+ and beyond.
- The **Markdown Editor** is built with Angular **signals**, fully customizable, and includes a smart toolbar and preview support using `ngx-markdown`.

## 🎯 Library Goals

- **Modularity:** Import only what you need.
- **Compatibility:** Built for Angular 16+ (up to 19+).
- **Customization:** Designed for flexible theming and component behavior.
- **Scalability:** Great for small apps or large enterprise projects.
- **Future-proof:** Continually updated to support Angular's latest features.
