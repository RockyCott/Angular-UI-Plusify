# Angular UI Plusify 🌟

A modular library of components and directives for Angular, designed to enhance your UI development experience. 🚀

## 🚧 Project Status

Angular UI Plusify is in its early stages of development, and the **Datetime Picker** is its first component. This library aims to grow by adding more UI components and directives in the future, making it a one-stop solution for Angular UI development.

### Why Angular UI Plusify?
The **Datetime Picker** is based on the original [`@angular-material-components/datetime-picker`](https://github.com/h2qutc/angular-material-components) but modernized for **Angular 16+**. This ensures compatibility and support for the latest Angular Material updates, providing developers with a reliable, up-to-date solution.
